# Phase 4 Implementation Progress

## Week 1: Fix Critical Issues & Improve Test Coverage ✅

### Day 1-2: Core Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Fix AgentRegistry missing methods (`get()`, `get_by_type()`)
- ✅ Fix ClassifierAgent input handling (dict/string support)
- ✅ Update test mocks to match actual interfaces
- ✅ Fix DevCoordinator test expectations

### Day 3-4: Test Coverage Improvement ✅ IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Add unit tests for ClassifierAgent (22% → 81% coverage)
- ✅ Add unit tests for PlannerAgent (27% → 65% coverage) 
- ✅ Add unit tests for CLI (0% → 28% coverage)
- ✅ Add unit tests for Deployer (0% → partial coverage)
- ✅ Fix PlannerAgent KeyError issue
- **Target: 60% overall coverage** - Current: 40% ✅ Progress

### Day 5: Integration Testing 🔄 NEXT
- [ ] Add end-to-end integration tests
- [ ] Test full workflow: request → planning → execution → deployment
- [ ] Fix remaining API server test issues

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ Achievements
- **Test Coverage**: 28% → 40% (+12%)
- **Passing Tests**: 27 → 40 (+13 tests)
- **Critical Issues Fixed**: Registry API, ClassifierAgent input, PlannerAgent KeyError
- **New Test Modules**: ClassifierAgent, PlannerAgent, CLI, Deployer

### 🔄 In Progress
- API server TestClient compatibility issues (6 failing tests)
- Deployer test AWS mocking (3 errors)
- Integration testing setup

### 📋 Next Immediate Actions
1. **Fix API server tests** - TestClient compatibility
2. **Add AutoAgentComposer tests** - Critical for agent generation
3. **Add end-to-end integration tests**
4. **Reach 60% coverage target**

## Week 2: API & UI Improvements (PLANNED)

### Day 1-2: API Server Enhancements
- [ ] Fix all failing API endpoints
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Day 3-4: Frontend Development
- [ ] Create basic React/Vue frontend for API
- [ ] Implement workflow visualization
- [ ] Add agent monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create feedback submission UI

### Day 5: Authentication & Security
- [ ] Add API key authentication
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add rate limiting

## Success Metrics Progress

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Test Pass Rate | 100% | 83% (40/48) | 🔄 In Progress |
| Code Coverage | 80% | 40% | 🔄 In Progress |
| API Response Time | <200ms | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| Security Vulnerabilities | 0 | TBD | ⏳ Pending |
| Documentation Coverage | 100% | 80% | 🔄 In Progress |

## Risk Assessment

### 🟢 Low Risk
- Core functionality working
- Registry and classification fixed
- Test infrastructure solid

### 🟡 Medium Risk  
- API server compatibility issues
- AWS service mocking complexity
- Integration test complexity

### 🔴 High Risk
- None currently identified

## Next Steps (Today)

1. **Fix API server TestClient issues** - Update to compatible version
2. **Add AutoAgentComposer tests** - Critical missing coverage
3. **Create integration test framework** - End-to-end testing
4. **Target 50% coverage** - Incremental improvement
