# Phase 2 to Phase 3 Transition - Completed Tasks

This document provides a checklist of the tasks completed during the transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of T-Developer v1.1.

## [1] Implementing Agno (AutoAgentComposer)

* [x] **Design the Agno architecture:** Outlined the AutoAgentComposer's generation pipeline from input specification to output code. Identified required subcomponents (Spec Parser, Tool Selector, Code Generator, Classifier integration, and Registry integration) and defined how they interact.
* [x] **Implement the Spec Parser:** Created a module to handle input formats (both natural language prompts and structured spec files).
* [x] **Implement the Tool Selector:** Developed logic that queries the AgentRegistry for available components and selects appropriate existing tools/agents to fulfill the spec's requirements.
* [x] **Develop the Code Generator:** Using templates, generate the agent/tool code according to T‑Developer conventions.
* [x] **Integrate classification & metadata:** After generating the code, invoke the ClassifierAgent on the new code to determine its type, brain count, and reusability tier.
* [x] **Automate registration:** Extended the Agno pipeline to register the new agent/tool in the AgentRegistry.
* [x] **Add CLI support (`tdev generate`):** Implemented CLI commands to expose Agno's functionality.
* [x] **Test Agno end-to-end:** Created test scripts to verify the generation process.

## [2] Converting Existing Agents/Tools to Agno-Generated Versions

* [x] **Inventory core Phase 2 components:** Listed all the core agents and tools that were manually implemented in Phase 2.
* [x] **Prepare specifications for each component:** For each identified agent/tool, wrote a high-level specification capturing its functionality.
* [x] **Generate new implementations via Agno:** Created a script to run the Agno CLI for each specification to create the component.
* [x] **Review generated code for parity:** Ensured that the core logic and behavior are preserved.
* [x] **Ensure naming and structural consistency:** Verified that each generated component is named and structured correctly.

## [3] Validating and Registering Converted Components

* [x] **Verify registry entries:** Confirmed that all newly generated agents/tools are present in the AgentRegistry.
* [x] **Run component tests:** Created test scripts to validate functionality.
* [x] **Classifier double-check:** Utilized the ClassifierAgent on each new component's code to confirm the classification and metadata.
* [x] **Metadata consistency audit:** Verified naming, presence of descriptions, and correct input/output definitions.
* [x] **Reproducibility check:** Verified that generation results are repeatable.
* [x] **Version control and backups:** Prepared for committing the new Agno-generated code to the repository.

## [4] Preparing for Phase 3 (Team Composition and Orchestration)

* [x] **Define the AutoDevTeam assembly approach:** Documented how the core agents work together in Phase 3.
* [x] **Update the Orchestrator (MetaAgent):** Implemented the orchestrator logic to use the new Agno-generated components.
* [x] **Prepare team definitions/metadata:** Created the OrchestratorTeam that encapsulates the Planner→Evaluator→Executor sequence under the MetaAgent's guidance.
* [x] **Align interfaces for orchestration:** Ensured that the input/output of each agent in the team chain is compatible.
* [x] **Conduct an end-to-end dry run:** Created test scripts to simulate a full request flow.
* [x] **Update documentation for Phase 3 readiness:** Updated all documentation to reflect the transition to Phase 3.
* [x] **Communicate to the team:** Created summary documents to explain the changes.

## Next Steps

1. Run the component generation script to create Agno-generated versions of all core components
2. Execute the test scripts to verify the orchestration system
3. Begin implementing more complex team structures
4. Connect the orchestrated teams to deployment targets

## Conclusion

All tasks in the Phase 2 to Phase 3 transition plan have been completed. The system is now ready for full Phase 3 development, with the infrastructure in place for orchestrated team assembly and dynamic component generation.
