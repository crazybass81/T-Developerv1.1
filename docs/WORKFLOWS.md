# Workflow Guide

## What is a Workflow?

In T-Developer, a **Workflow** is a sequence of steps involving agents and tools that work together to achieve a specific goal. Workflows define the execution flow, data passing between components, and overall process for completing tasks.

## Creating Workflows

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Create a simple workflow using the EchoAgent
tdev compose --name echo-flow --steps EchoAgent

# Create a multi-step workflow
tdev compose --name process-flow --steps "DataFetchAgent,ProcessorAgent,OutputAgent"

# Create a workflow from a JSON definition
tdev compose --file workflow-definition.json
```

### Workflow Definition Format

Workflows can be defined in JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "workflow-name-v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step1",
      "agent": "XAgent",
      "input": { "param": "value" }
    },
    {
      "id": "step2",
      "agent": "YTool",
      "input": { "data": "${step1.result}" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Executing Workflows

```bash
# Run a workflow by name
tdev run echo-flow

# Run a workflow with specific input
tdev run process-flow --input '{"data": "input value"}'

# Run a workflow and save the output
tdev run process-flow --output results.json
```

## Dynamic Workflow Generation

The PlannerAgent can automatically generate workflows based on goals:

```bash
# Generate and execute a workflow for a goal
tdev orchestrate "Process and analyze the data from the API"
```

## Workflow Components

A workflow consists of:

1. **Steps**: Individual actions performed by agents or tools
2. **Data Flow**: How data passes between steps
3. **Conditions**: Optional logic for branching or looping
4. **Error Handling**: How to handle failures in steps

## Advanced Workflow Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple steps simultaneously
- **Conditional Branching**: Execute different steps based on conditions
- **Error Recovery**: Define fallback steps or retry logic
- **Workflow Versioning**: Track changes to workflows over time

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Step Naming**: Use descriptive names for workflow steps
2. **Data Validation**: Validate inputs and outputs at each step
3. **Modularity**: Design workflows to be composable and reusable
4. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and expected behavior of workflows
5. **Testing**: Test workflows with various inputs and edge cases
