# T-Developer v1.1 Architecture

## System Overview

T-Developer v1.1 is a **meta-agent orchestration framework** for automating software development tasks and composing SaaS applications from reusable components. The system enables complex goals to be achieved by a coordinated "squad" of specialized AI agents, automating the workflow from understanding a request to delivering a functional deployed service.

## Core Components

### Hierarchical Component Model

All building blocks are classified as:
- **Tools**: No decision logic ("0 brains")
- **Agents**: Single decision point ("1 brain")
- **Teams**: Multi-agent assemblies ("2+ brains")

### Agent Squad Orchestrator (MetaAgent)

The central coordinator of the system, implemented as a MetaAgent (also called **DevCoordinator** or SupervisorAgent). It controls the flow of tasks and information among specialized agents:

- Initiates and manages end-to-end workflows for user requests
- Delegates tasks to core agents and collects their outputs
- Makes high-level decisions based on agent outputs
- Handles exceptions and control flow
- Coordinates parallelism or team execution when applicable

### Core Agents

1. **ClassifierAgent**: Determines what kind of component an input is
2. **PlannerAgent**: Devises a plan (workflow) to achieve the goal
3. **EvaluatorAgent**: Reviews plan quality and provides feedback
4. **WorkflowExecutorAgent**: Carries out the plan step by step

### Agno (AutoAgentComposer)

The agent generation subsystem that automatically creates new agents or tools when existing components lack a capability for a given task. Key functions:

- Takes specifications for desired capabilities
- Analyzes requirements and plans implementation
- Generates code and metadata for new components
- Registers new components in the system

### AWS Bedrock Agent Core

The underlying AI and agent execution framework providing:
- Foundation models for language understanding and generation
- Agent Core SDK for easy integration with AWS services
- Decision logic framework for agent behavior

### User Interface Integrations

- **CLI**: Command-line interface for direct control
- **Web UI**: Visual interface for interaction and monitoring
- **Future IDE Plugins**: Integration with development environments

## Data Flow and Integration

T-Developer integrates with development workflows and cloud infrastructure:
- Runs locally via CLI for development
- Deploys services to AWS (Lambda, ECS) for production
- Hooks into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

All agents and tools are registered in a central **AgentRegistry**, enabling reuse in future workflows. The system is extensible â€“ new components can be added manually or via generation.

## Current Status

T-Developer v1.1 is currently in Phase 3 development, focusing on team composition and orchestration capabilities.
