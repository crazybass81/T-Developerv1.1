# T-Developer v1.1 Development Roadmap

## Overview

T-Developer development has been divided into phases with clear milestones. This document outlines the roadmap, including completed work, current focus, and future plans.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework & MVP (Completed)

**Foundation laid**

- Established basic Agent Squad Orchestrator with fundamental roles
- Created component registry and basic CLI tools
- Developed sample agents and tools manually
- Implemented simple workflows with pre-built agents
- Demonstrated end-to-end functionality on a small scale
- Delivered a minimal viable product (v1.0)

*Note: This phase was completed prior to the major design revision.*

### Phase 2: Enhanced Orchestration & Initial Automation (Completed)

**Building intelligence**

- Introduced multi-agent workflows
- Integrated initial automatic code generation
- Upgraded Orchestrator to support dynamic planning
- Implemented more complex agent sequences (including parallel execution)
- Introduced the concept of "Teams" (multiple agents collaborating)
- Refined orchestrator's internal structure (added Classifier, Evaluator, etc.)
- Developed early versions of the Agno module for template-based generation
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Enabled auto-generation of boilerplate code with human oversight

### Phase 3: Full Automation and Agent Generation (In Progress)

**Current focus (v1.1 development)**

- Implementing the revised architecture with all key components
- Fully integrating Agno for automatic agent composition
- Refactoring Orchestrator to use Meta-Agent approach
- Adding new CLI commands and developer tools
- Integrating Amazon Q Developer for code quality and testing
- Finalizing AWS Bedrock Agent Core integration
- Connecting to cloud deployment targets
- Achieving true end-to-end automation with minimal human input

**Current Status:**
- Transition to Phase 3 architecture is largely complete
- Automatic agent generation and team orchestration capabilities are in place
- Documentation has been updated
- Testing the orchestration system and cloud infrastructure integration
- Refining reliability and performance
- In the final implementation and testing stretch

### Phase 4: Extended Features and Refinement (Planned)

**Future enhancements**

1. **Agent Versioning & A/B Testing**
   - Deploy multiple versions of the same agent
   - Compare performance between different implementations
   - Enable canary releases of agent improvements
   - Automatically promote better-performing versions

2. **Multi-Tenancy and Sandbox Environments**
   - Support multiple organizations/users with strict isolation
   - Provide per-user or per-project workspaces
   - Track resource usage per user with rate limiting
   - Segregate AWS resources by tenant
   - Implement administration features for organizations

3. **Internationalization (i18n)**
   - Expand language support for UI and agent operation
   - Enable requests in various languages
   - Implement translation agents
   - Use locale-specific prompt templates for better accuracy

4. **Plugin Ecosystem for Models/Tools**
   - Create plugin architecture for new AI models and tools
   - Build connector agents for external systems
   - Develop a marketplace for third-party agent and tool plugins
   - Foster a community around custom agents

5. **Continuous Learning and Autonomy**
   - Incorporate self-learning capabilities
   - Optimize from user feedback and past solutions
   - Enable reuse of previously created agents
   - Enhance Evaluator to predict user satisfaction
   - Implement automatic refactoring of common patterns

6. **Additional Integrations and Deployment Targets**
   - Support environments beyond AWS-centric cloud
   - Offer containerized deployment (Kubernetes)
   - Integrate with more chat platforms and DevOps tools
   - Make the platform available as standalone, bot, or API service
   - Publish on AWS Marketplace with CloudFormation/CDK templates

## Current Progress

The project is currently in the late stage of Phase 3 (v1.1 development):
- Phases 1 and 2 are complete
- Core functionality for v1.1 is nearing completion
- Approximately two-thirds through the planned development journey for v1.x
- On track for v1.1 release, with no major blockers remaining
