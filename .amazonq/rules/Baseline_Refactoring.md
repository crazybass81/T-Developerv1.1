## AWS Agent Squad-based Orchestrator Implementation Feasibility and Approach

Replacing or integrating the current **DevCoordinator** with AWS open-source **Agent Squad** framework is feasible and offers significant benefits. The **SupervisorAgent** concept in Agent Squad is similar to T-Developer's DevCoordinator, which groups multiple specialized agents into a team to handle requests. For example, the orchestrator, such as **Planner**, **Classifier**, **Evaluator**, and **WorkflowExecutor**, can break down and analyze requests to select the appropriate agents and manage the execution flow. This transition from DevCoordinator to the Agent Squad framework will enhance the flexibility of multi-agent collaboration and intelligent workflow management. The **SupervisorAgent** in Agent Squad supports parallel execution, context maintenance, and dynamic task delegation, making it a perfect replacement for DevCoordinator.

## Required Structural Changes (Composition and Execution Model)

To switch to the Agent Squad framework, several adjustments are needed for the **orchestration structure** and **agent interfaces**:

* **Agent Wrapping and Registration**: The existing T-Developer agent objects must be wrapped to comply with the Agent Squad system. A wrapper class needs to be introduced that implements the Agent Squad's `Agent` interface, allowing T-Developer's **PlannerAgent**, **EvaluatorAgent**, etc., to be callable within Agent Squad. This can be achieved by wrapping the internal agents in T-Developer with a structure like `SquadWrapperAgent`, integrating them with Agent Squad without significantly altering the logic. This way, existing agent logic can be reused and still be included in the SupervisorAgent team.

* **Using the SupervisorAgent**: The DevCoordinator needs to be restructured to use **SupervisorAgent** as the central orchestrator. Currently, DevCoordinator executes a fixed sequence of Planner → Evaluator → Executor in the code, but with Agent Squad, this flow can be replaced by the SupervisorAgent, which dynamically calls the required agents in sequence or parallel. This change allows for more dynamic and prompt-driven execution, where the **lead agent** (e.g., an LLM such as Claude 2) manages and calls the necessary agents like **PlannerAgent** at the right times. Instead of calling `DevCoordinator.run()`, we would now call `supervisor.process_request()`.

* **Configuration and Setup Changes**: In Agent Squad, agent teams and class types are defined using JSON/YAML configuration or code. T-Developer also relies on **Agent Registry** to manage agents, so there will need to be a mechanism to transfer **agent metadata** from the registry to Agent Squad. For instance, if **PlannerAgent** is registered in the Registry, it must be fetched and included in the SupervisorAgent team configuration. Additionally, the decision to use Agent Squad's **Classifier** needs to be made (our **ClassifierAgent** helps select agents for each workflow stage). The classification logic should be adapted to Agent Squad’s interface.

* **Modularization and Prompt Management**: Switching to Agent Squad as the orchestrator introduces the importance of managing **prompt templates** and **system messages**. The **lead agent** (LLM) will need to manage how it calls team members and handles their responses. This requires modular management, where the **SupervisorAgentOptions** can define the roles and instructions for team members, or use separate prompt files/classes. Furthermore, for multi-turn dialogues, **context memory** should be integrated using Agent Squad’s memory features, leveraging **AWS Agent Core** for conversation history management.

Through these changes, the **DevCoordinator** will be replaced with the **SupervisorAgent (meta-agent)**, with **Planner/Evaluator** remaining as tools within the agent team, and the workflow control transitioning from rule-based code to LLM-driven prompt-based execution.

## Integration of Existing Agents and Role Transformation Feasibility

**Existing agents like Planner, Evaluator** can be easily integrated into the Agent Squad framework. The **wrapper** introduced will allow **PlannerAgent**, **EvaluatorAgent**, **ClassifierAgent**, **WorkflowExecutorAgent**, etc., to be registered as members of the SupervisorAgent team, retaining their specialized roles while leveraging Agent Squad’s orchestration. The **PlannerAgent** will continue to decompose the user goal into tasks, but will now be called by the lead agent (LLM) when needed. Similarly, the **EvaluatorAgent** will review and give feedback on generated plans.

However, some roles may need to be restructured. For example, **PlannerAgent/EvaluatorAgent** currently operates using AWS Bedrock LLMs, but with the introduction of **SupervisorAgent**, the lead agent could take over the planning and evaluation tasks, only calling supporting agents when needed. In the early stages, it is safer to keep existing agents separate as tools with clear roles. As we refine the prompt design, a **single LLM** might take on both **Planner** and **Evaluator** roles or new roles (e.g., **ObserverAgent**, **FeedbackCollector**) could be added for monitoring and feedback collection.

Moreover, **Agno** can still be used for **automatic agent creation**, and this can be tightly integrated with Agent Squad. For instance, when **Planner** or **Classifier** detects the need for a new agent, the **SupervisorAgent** will call **Agno** to generate the necessary agent code, and the newly created agent will be automatically registered in the Agent Squad team or used in subsequent requests.

## Technical Risks and Limitations

The introduction of Agent Squad and restructuring of the system comes with the following technical risks and limitations:

* **Increased Orchestration Complexity and Reliability**: Delegating part of the orchestration to the **LLM-based SupervisorAgent** introduces potential unpredictability. The LLM might fail to call the Planner or select the wrong team member. Therefore, thorough **prompt engineering** and extensive scenario testing are required to ensure the LLM orchestrates correctly. A **fallback logic** or **limiters** should be implemented to handle situations where the LLM makes incorrect decisions.

* **Performance and Costs**: Using the **SupervisorAgent** will involve multiple **LLM API calls**, leading to increased response time and costs. For example, the lead agent may call the Planner, receive the output, then call the Evaluator. This will increase **latency** and incur higher costs due to **Bedrock** API calls. Some optimization methods like caching previous results or skipping less critical steps may be necessary to reduce costs. Additionally, **Lambda executions** for Agent Core may add to the operational expenses.

* **Integration Complexity**: There might be **compatibility issues** when integrating Agent Squad into the existing codebase. For example, **Agent Registry** and **Agent Squad** might require synchronization for agent metadata. Additionally, the **CLI**, **API Server**, and other components dependent on **DevCoordinator** will need to be restructured. This includes changes to how commands like `tdev orchestrate` interact with the new **SupervisorAgent**.

* **Security and Permissions**: Managing the permissions for automatically generated and executed agents is crucial. **Agent Core** provides isolation through Lambda, but the code generated by **Agno** must be carefully checked for vulnerabilities. **Evaluator** or **Q Developer** should analyze newly created code to ensure no malicious logic is introduced, and the **IAM roles** should enforce the **least privilege** principle to avoid unnecessary access to resources.

* **Learning and Context Limits**: Even though Agent Squad will be leveraged for orchestration, the underlying **LLM’s context limits** can impact performance, especially with large, complex tasks. There may be scenarios where the **prompt token limit** is exceeded, or the quality of planning and code generation may suffer. To mitigate this, we can split the tasks into smaller chunks or employ **human-in-the-loop** for prompt correction when necessary.

## New Integrated Architecture Concept

**Diagram: Concept of Agent Squad’s SupervisorAgent Coordinating Multiple Specialized Agents** – The **SupervisorAgent** in Agent Squad (top agent) has a **lead agent** (LLM-based) and multiple **team agents**. The lead agent calls team members as tools to process complex requests. When applied to our system, the **Agent Squad Orchestrator** integrates **Agno**, **Q Developer**, and **Bedrock Agent Core** in a seamless pipeline. The flow is as follows:

1. **Request Reception and Analysis**: User requests (via web UI, Slack chatbot, CLI, etc.) are received by the **Agent Squad Orchestrator (SupervisorAgent)**. The lead agent (e.g., Claude 2) understands the request and prepares to use the team members. If the input is code, the **ClassifierAgent** categorizes the type and purpose; if it's a general goal, the **PlannerAgent** plans the steps.

2. **Agent Mapping and New Agent Creation**: Based on the **PlannerAgent**'s plan, the **ClassifierAgent** checks the existing agents and matches them. If no agent fits a task, the **SupervisorAgent** will ask **Agno** to create the required agent. **Agno** generates the agent code, and the agent is immediately registered in the Agent Squad team.

3. **Code Refactoring and Testing (Q Developer)**: The generated code is committed to the **GitHub repository** and enters the CI pipeline. **Q Developer** inspects the code for quality, performance, and security. **Automated test cases** are generated, and improvements are suggested.

4. **Deployment and Execution (Agent Core)**: After Q Developer approval, the code is deployed to the **Agent Core** using **AWS Lambda**. Agent Core manages execution, resource usage, and logs. The **WorkflowExecutorAgent** or **Orchestrator** runs the entire workflow, coordinating all agents and returning results to the user.

This architecture enables **end-to-end automation** of software design, implementation, and deployment, with **Agent Squad** providing the flexibility to integrate and extend various components dynamically.
