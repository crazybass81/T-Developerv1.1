Understood. I’ll review the entire T-developer v1.1 repository, compare it against the roadmap created from the "에이전트 자동화 플랫폼 시스템 설계" document, and determine the current progress.

Then, I’ll provide an English instruction document detailing the most appropriate next steps—whether they are technical implementations or coordination tasks—based on the repository’s current state.


# T-Developer v1.1 Status and Roadmap Alignment

## Current Roadmap Status

* **Phase Progress:** The project is currently in **Phase 3 (Team Composition and Orchestration)** of its roadmap. This means the foundation for multi-agent collaboration is in place, focusing on assembling specialized agents into teams to handle complex tasks. Core architectural concepts – **Tools**, **Agents**, and **Teams** – are established, corresponding to 0-brain functions, 1-brain autonomous agents, and multi-brain coordinated teams respectively.

* **Orchestrator Implemented:** A central orchestration mechanism exists. The code includes a **DevCoordinatorAgent** (also referred to as a MetaAgent or Supervisor) that uses the Agent Squad pattern to coordinate core agents. These core agents (Classifier, Planner, Evaluator, WorkflowExecutor, etc.) are implemented and registered, allowing the orchestrator to sequence them for end-to-end request handling. For example, the OrchestratorTeam/DevCoordinator pipelines a user request through classification, planning, evaluation, and execution stages to produce a result. This aligns with the design’s vision of an agent squad handling “Planner → Classifier → Evaluator → Executor” in workflow orchestration.

* **Agent Generation (Agno) Available:** The system includes the **AutoAgentComposerAgent** (“Agno”) for automatic agent/tool generation. This component is implemented and integrated into the platform. Via CLI commands, developers can generate new agent or tool code from a specification (`tdev generate agent/tool …`). The AutoAgentComposer uses predefined templates to scaffold new agent classes and registers them in the central registry. This fulfills the design concept of an *agent generator* that expands the system’s capabilities on demand (though current implementation is template-based, as discussed later).

* **Core Framework & CLI:** The basic framework for managing components is in place. A **component registry** tracks all tools, agents, and teams, with functionalities to register and instantiate them dynamically. There is a command-line interface (`tdev`) that supports initializing new components, registering them, composing workflows, running teams, and orchestrating goals. For instance, you can create an example workflow and run it, or invoke the orchestrator with a natural language goal (`tdev orchestrate "Your request"`). This CLI serves as a developer-facing interface (the design’s CLI/IDE integration aspect) and confirms that the project’s foundational commands are operational.

* **Testing Mechanism:** An initial testing approach exists, albeit basic. The repository defines an **AgentTesterAgent** to validate other agents/tools by running test cases. By default, it can perform simple echo tests to ensure an agent’s output matches expected output. A pytest test suite structure is present (allowing `pytest` to run). This corresponds to a rudimentary “testing framework” mentioned in the feature list, indicating progress toward automated validation of agent behaviors. More sophisticated test generation (as envisioned with Amazon Q) is not yet implemented but the scaffolding for testing is in place.

## Gap Summary: Design vs. Implementation

Despite the solid progress, there are clear gaps between the **envisioned design** (from the “에이전트 자동화 플랫폼 시스템 설계” roadmap) and the **current codebase**:

* **Workflow Planning Logic:** The **PlannerAgent** is implemented only as a stub. Currently it returns a hard-coded single-step workflow (e.g., just an `EchoAgent` step) for any given goal. This is far from the design’s intent where the Planner should analyze a complex request and break it into multiple detailed steps and sub-tasks autonomously. In the design’s **“기능 기획 단계”** (feature planning stage), an AI-driven Planner is supposed to interpret the user’s natural language request and produce a structured development plan (potentially with several agents/tools involved) that a developer could review or refine. That level of sophisticated multi-step planning has not been realized yet in the code.

* **Evaluation & Feedback:** The **EvaluatorAgent** is present but not functionally developed. In the current state it simply returns a static high score and dummy metrics, without truly analyzing the workflow or output. Consequently, there is no real feedback loop or conditional refinement happening – the system does not yet adjust plans or code based on evaluation results. This contrasts with the roadmap’s vision: during the **“품질 보강 단계”** (quality enhancement stage), a dedicated Evaluator (or evaluation process) would detect issues (e.g., failing tests or suboptimal plans) and trigger iterative improvements. For example, the design suggests that if tests fail or output is incorrect, the Evaluator should feed that information back by suggesting a plan revision or requesting the generator to fix the code. As of now, such automated refinement is not active – the placeholder evaluator does not close the loop as intended.

* **Agent Orchestration Depth:** While the orchestrator exists, the **current orchestration is not fully leveraging AI reasoning**. The DevCoordinatorAgent is hooked into AWS Bedrock (via the Agent Squad Supervisor with a Bedrock LLM), but it’s unclear to what extent this is configured or functioning. The OrchestratorTeam has a fallback “legacy” sequence that runs the core agents in order directly. This means much of the orchestration logic is still linear and rule-based in code. The grand design describes a more dynamic orchestration, potentially guided by an LLM “lead agent” to handle complex coordination and even parallel tasks. Features like parallel execution of independent steps or conditional branching in workflows (mentioned as future extensions) are not yet present – currently all workflows are executed step-by-step serially.

* **Auto-Generation Intelligence:** The **Agno (AutoAgentComposer)** module generates code using static templates rather than true AI-driven coding. It can create a new agent or tool file with the correct class/function structure, but the implementation body is essentially a placeholder (e.g., `result = input_data  # Replace with actual implementation`). The roadmap envisioned the **“자동 구현 단계”** (automatic implementation stage) where a GPT-class model (similar to Amazon CodeWhisperer) writes substantial portions of the new code. In practice, the current system does *not* integrate an LLM to produce business logic – it requires a developer to fill in the blanks after generation. In short, T-Developer v1.1 has the mechanism to scaffold new agents, but not to truly generate their internal logic using AI as described in the design.

* **Automated Quality Assurance:** There is **no integration of Amazon Q Developer or equivalent AI for testing and analysis** yet. The design’s quality stage calls for AI-driven test generation and static analysis (linting, security scans, etc.) to automatically improve code quality. In the codebase, we do not see any module calling an AI to create tests or performing static analysis on generated code. The current EvaluatorAgent does not incorporate test execution results, and the AgentTester requires manual test case input. Therefore, the whole layer where *“Amazon Q Developer generates missing test cases and elevates code quality, feeding back problems for automatic fixes”* is absent. This means the burden of writing tests and catching issues still largely falls on humans or simple stubs, whereas the roadmap intended these to be largely automated by AI assistance.

* **CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment:** The **Continuous Integration/Deployment** aspect is not implemented in this repository. In the design, once code and tests are ready, a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions triggered on code push) should build, test, and automatically deploy the new functionality to production without human intervention. Right now, T-Developer v1.1 does not include scripts or configuration for automatic deployment of generated agents. There’s no evidence of GitHub Actions workflows configured for this project (at least none in the repository), and deployment steps are not triggered by the orchestrator. In other words, after an agent is generated or updated, getting it running on a server or cloud service is a manual or out-of-band process. This is a significant gap: the platform is not yet “one-click” deploying new agents to the cloud as envisioned (e.g., deploying to AWS Lambda via Bedrock Agent Core). The design explicitly highlights that passing tests should result in automatic deployment to a serverless environment on AWS Bedrock, with failures causing a loop back to development – that continuous deployment loop is not realized yet.

* **Runtime Environment & Agent Core Integration:** Related to deployment, the **AWS Bedrock Agent Core integration** is only partial. The design calls for agents to run in a secure, scalable serverless runtime (Bedrock’s Agent Core), providing services like isolated execution (sandboxed Lambdas), memory management, web browsing tools, and seamless external integrations. In the current implementation, aside from using a Bedrock LLM for orchestration, there is no implementation of deploying an agent into an AWS Lambda or using Bedrock’s memory or sandbox services. For example, if an agent were generated to perform some function, there’s no code to actually provision it on AWS or manage its lifecycle in the cloud. The system still runs locally (or in whatever environment the CLI is invoked) without hooking into the cloud-based execution layer. Features like long-term memory, secure code execution, or the Bedrock gateway for Slack integration remain **not integrated** at this stage.

* **Monitoring and Continuous Feedback:** The platform does **not yet implement the monitoring and feedback loop** described in the roadmap’s operations stage. In an ideal state, once an agent is deployed, the system would monitor its performance (logs, metrics) and handle user feedback or runtime errors by feeding that data back to improve the agents. Currently, there is no dashboard or monitoring tool connected to T-Developer v1.1, and no automated way for the running system to accept feedback (aside from a user manually reviewing and adjusting things). The EvaluatorAgent is not tied into any runtime monitoring. Additionally, linking errors or improvements back into the development cycle (e.g., auto-creating GitHub issues or triggering re-planning) isn’t implemented. The codebase doesn’t show any logic for observing a deployed service’s behavior or a mechanism to loop that information into agent improvements – a gap from the *“운영 및 모니터링 단계”* which envisioned real-time logs and continuous improvement cycles.

* **User Interface & Integration Channels:** **User-facing interfaces are not part of this repository.** T-Developer v1.1’s code is primarily backend logic and CLI. However, the design document emphasizes a multi-channel user interface: a web application UI (dashboard with chat-style interaction), a Slack chatbot interface, and IDE/CLI integrations for developers. These would allow users (non-technical or developers) to submit feature requests in natural language and watch the progress. As of now, those UI components are either in separate projects or not implemented. For example, there is no web server or Slack bot code here. The current way to interact is via the CLI or possibly by importing the library in Python – which is suitable for developers but not the friendly UI envisioned for end users. This is a known gap: the **agent-ui** and Slack integration will need to be developed and connected so that the orchestration engine can be driven from a web or chat interface as described (e.g., displaying the plan breakdown, agent status, and logs in real time). Until such integration is done, the system cannot yet deliver the seamless user experience outlined in the roadmap.

## Recommended Next Tasks

To move T-Developer forward and closer to the roadmap’s goals, the following next steps are recommended. These are prioritized to address the most critical gaps, combining **technical implementation tasks** with any necessary **organizational actions**:

* **Enhance Planning & Orchestration Logic:** Improve the Planner and overall orchestration so the system can handle complex requests intelligently. Specifically, implement a more robust **PlannerAgent** that can break down goals into multi-step workflows (possibly by calling an LLM or using heuristic rules) instead of returning a one-step stub. Similarly, upgrade the **EvaluatorAgent** to genuinely assess workflow quality and outcomes – it should be able to decide when a plan needs revision or when a newly generated agent might be failing. This may involve setting up criteria for success and using feedback from test results or runtime data. In essence, close the loop on the core agent orchestration: after Planner creates a plan and execution runs it, ensure the Evaluator can trigger a refinement cycle if the result isn’t satisfactory (aligning with the design’s feedback mechanism). Technically, this could mean integrating more AI reasoning (e.g., using the Bedrock LLM to critique or refine plans) and handling conditional logic in the orchestrator. Organizationally, a team member should be assigned to focus on the Planner/Evaluator improvements as a top priority.

* **Integrate Dynamic Agent Creation:** Enable on-the-fly agent generation during orchestration. Currently Agno exists but is not automatically invoked when an unknown capability is needed. The next step is to connect the Planner/Evaluator with the AutoAgentComposer. For example, if during planning or execution we detect a missing tool/agent (a capability gap), the system should call `DevCoordinatorAgent.handle_missing_capability()` (or a similar hook) to generate the new agent and then continue the workflow with it. This will realize the design scenario where the platform *creates new sub-agents mid-flight* to solve sub-tasks it initially didn’t know how to handle. Implementing this requires both code changes (to detect gaps and invoke the generator) and process changes (deciding how to incorporate the new agent’s code into the running system dynamically). To advance this, define clear conditions for “missing capability” (perhaps PlannerAgent returns a flag or Evaluator identifies an unmet requirement), and then use Agno to create the agent, register it, and update the workflow plan on the fly. This task should be undertaken once the Planner’s logic is a bit more advanced, and it may involve close coordination between whoever is improving the Planner and whoever maintains the Agno module.

* **Automate Testing and Quality Assurance:** Start integrating an AI-based quality assurance step as envisioned with **Amazon Q Developer**. Concretely, introduce a phase in the development workflow where, after an agent’s code is generated or a workflow is planned, an automated process generates test cases and performs static analysis. This could be done by leveraging Amazon CodeWhisperer/Amazon Q if available, or using a large language model to propose unit tests for the new code. The generated tests should then run (perhaps via the existing `AgentTesterAgent` or a testing harness) to validate the code’s behavior. Any failures or weaknesses detected should feed into the Evaluator or orchestrator logic to prompt fixes (for example, the EvaluatorAgent could capture test failure details and prompt the Planner/Agno to adjust the plan or code). Implementing this will likely require integrating external tools or services (like invoking Amazon Q Developer CLI or an AI API) from within the codebase. It’s a complex but crucial step to reduce manual effort in quality control. On the organizational side, this might involve working with teams familiar with QA automation or obtaining access to Amazon’s developer tools. Success here will fulfill the roadmap’s promise that *“AI fills in missing test scenarios and runs static scans, feeding back issues for automatic fixes”*.

* **Establish CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate the build-test-deploy cycle for new agents and workflows. This will likely involve creating GitHub Actions workflows (or using an equivalent CI service) in the repository. The pipeline should: run the test suite (including any AI-generated tests) for each new code commit or agent generation, and if tests pass, automatically package and deploy the agent/service to the cloud. Deployment could mean zipping a function and deploying to AWS Lambda, or building a Docker image and pushing to AWS EKS/Fargate, depending on the target runtime. Initially, focusing on the simplest deployment path (AWS Lambda via Bedrock Agent Core) is advisable. This step realizes the **CI/CD 및 배포 단계** from the design, where code that passes tests is immediately released with no human intervention. It may require collaboration with DevOps personnel or setting up AWS credentials and infrastructure for deployment. As part of this task, also consider updating the registry or system state when a new agent is deployed (so the platform knows the agent is live and can route requests to it, if applicable). The team should allocate someone with DevOps expertise to implement and maintain this pipeline.

* **Deploy to AWS Bedrock Agent Core:** In parallel with setting up CI/CD, work on deeper **integration with the AWS Bedrock Agent Core environment**. The goal is that when an agent or workflow is ready, it is not just a Python class on a local machine, but a live service accessible via the Bedrock infrastructure (secure, scalable, and integratable). To do this, you might need to utilize the Bedrock AgentCore SDK or APIs (perhaps the provided `bedrock-agentcore-sdk-python` repository can help) to programmatically deploy agents. For example, use Bedrock’s gateway to expose an agent as an endpoint or instruct Bedrock to spin up a Lambda for it. Ensure that any deployment step also registers the deployed agent’s details (endpoint URL, version, etc.) back into T-Developer’s registry or knowledge base, so the orchestrator can use the new agent in future workflows. This task will likely involve writing deployment scripts and possibly CloudFormation/Terraform templates as well. Achieving this will bridge the gap between development and production, turning the platform into a true SaaS application builder as intended.

* **Implement Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** After deployment capabilities are in place, add **monitoring and feedback mechanisms** to close the DevOps loop. This includes setting up logging and monitoring for deployed agents (e.g., CloudWatch logs and metrics for each agent function) and building a feedback pipeline. For the platform, create a way to collect runtime information – for instance, an **Observability** agent or service that the orchestrator can query or that pushes alerts when something goes wrong. Then extend the EvaluatorAgent or orchestrator to handle this data: if a deployed agent encounters errors or users report bad results, the system should capture that and translate it into actions (perhaps automatically create a GitHub issue or trigger the Planner to start a “fix” workflow). On the user side, implement channels for feedback: e.g., allow users to flag a result as incorrect through the UI or Slack, which then notifies the orchestrator. This will realize the continuous improvement cycle described in the design, where operational issues feed into development without waiting for manual intervention. Setting this up may involve both coding (to tie in monitoring APIs and events to the T-Developer logic) and coordination with whoever is building the UI/Slack integration to ensure feedback can be input easily.

* **User Interface & API Integration:** Begin connecting the **front-end interfaces** to the T-Developer backend. Even if the UI (web portal and Slack bot) is being developed separately, there needs to be a defined API or mechanism for those interfaces to trigger the orchestration workflow and retrieve status updates. A near-term task is to expose an **API endpoint or SDK** that the Web UI and Slack bot can call (for example, an HTTP API in the `agent-api` project that invokes `tdev orchestrate` under the hood). Then collaborate with the UI team to implement features like displaying the plan breakdown, listing available agents, and streaming logs/progress as tasks execute. Essentially, make sure the rich information that T-Developer generates (the plan steps, agent outputs, etc.) is accessible to be rendered in the UI. Additionally, incorporate controls for the user as described (e.g. the ability to approve a plan or view generated code from the UI) – this might require pausing workflows until a user approves or having the orchestrator take “options” from the UI. Since this is a cross-cutting concern, assign a point person to coordinate between backend and frontend teams. Delivering a working UI integration will dramatically improve usability and fulfill the design’s promise of a non-technical user interface for the platform.

* **Advanced Workflow Features:** Looking forward, implement advanced orchestration capabilities such as **parallel task execution, conditional branches, and learning mechanisms**. The design mentions future extensions like running independent steps in parallel, incorporating feedback loops more intelligently, and learning from past executions to improve planning. These are complex enhancements, but it’s wise to plan for them early. For example, you could extend the Workflow definition to allow marking certain steps as parallelizable and modify WorkflowExecutorAgent to execute those concurrently (using asyncio or threads). Similarly, design a mechanism for the system to record outcomes of workflows and adjust its strategies (this could be as simple as tracking which agents or plans succeeded and using that data in PlannerAgent’s logic). While these are longer-term tasks, breaking them down and perhaps scheduling R\&D spikes on them will ensure the architecture can handle them when the time comes. They align with making the platform more robust and efficient, moving beyond the current linear flows.

* **Team Roles & Module Ownership (Organizational):** On the project management side, it’s important to **clarify ownership of each major component** and align the team on the roadmap. Now that the core framework is laid out, designate responsible owners for the Planner/Evaluator logic, the Agno generator, the CI/CD & infrastructure, and the UI integration. Each of these areas involves distinct expertise (AI/LLM integration, software architecture, DevOps, frontend), so dividing the tasks will help development progress in parallel. For instance, one sub-team can tackle improving the AI planning/evaluation cycle, while another works on deployment pipelines. Conduct a review of the “에이전트 자동화 플랫폼 시스템 설계” document with the team to ensure everyone understands the end-goal for each stage (planning, implementation, QA, deployment, ops). This will help non-technical team members see the big picture and allow technical members to coordinate their efforts towards the common vision. Regular check-ins can then be scheduled to integrate these streams (e.g., ensuring that once the CI/CD is ready, it is hooked into whatever the planning/generation team produces). By clearly assigning these next tasks and responsibilities, the team can efficiently deliver the remaining features of the roadmap.

Each of these steps brings the T-Developer platform closer to the fully automated, end-to-end development pipeline envisioned in the design. By focusing on the logical sequence – planning intelligence first, then dynamic generation, followed by quality automation, deployment, and finally user interface polish – the team can build momentum and demonstrate incremental successes. The recommended tasks above should be communicated in a roadmap update document for all stakeholders so that technical and non-technical team members alike understand what’s coming next and why it’s important. With these next actions, T-Developer v1.1 can progress from a promising framework to a truly autonomous development platform, achieving the key goals of development automation, multi-agent collaboration, and seamless user experience outlined in the system design.
