# T‑Developer TestRunHistoryStore Specification

The `TestRunHistoryStore` is a system-wide log and record structure that archives the results of test executions performed by `TestRunnerAgent` against `AgentTestSuite`. It serves as the persistent memory for all historical test data and enables analytics, version tracking, and continuous quality control.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Persist all test run outcomes (pass/fail, durations, metrics)
* Enable filtering of test results by agent, version, time, and result
* Support audit trails for CI/CD validation
* Feed EvaluatorAgent and AgentScoreModel with test history data

---

## 2. Record Schema

Each entry in the TestRunHistoryStore includes:

| Field            | Type     | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `run_id`         | string   | Unique ID for this test execution              |
| `agent_name`     | string   | Name of the agent under test                   |
| `version`        | string   | Version tested                                 |
| `timestamp`      | datetime | Time the test was executed                     |
| `result_summary` | object   | Aggregated result data (pass/fail/total)       |
| `failures`       | array    | List of failure cases with index and reason    |
| `duration`       | float    | Total test run duration (seconds)              |
| `triggered_by`   | string   | Who or what triggered the test (CI, CLI, etc.) |
| `tags`           | array    | Optional tags for categorization               |

## 3. Example JSON Entry

```json
{
  "run_id": "testrun-8391a",
  "agent_name": "SummarizerAgent",
  "version": "1.3.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T10:22:13Z",
  "result_summary": {
    "total": 12,
    "passed": 10,
    "failed": 2
  },
  "failures": [
    { "index": 3, "description": "Too long output" },
    { "index": 11, "description": "Empty response" }
  ],
  "duration": 5.24,
  "triggered_by": "CI-Pipeline",
  "tags": ["regression", "v1.3"]
}
```

---

## 4. Storage & Indexing

* Backed by DynamoDB or time-indexed S3 JSON
* Indexed by:

  * `agent_name + version`
  * `timestamp`
  * `result_status` (pass/fail)
* Append-only, immutable history

---

## 5. Integration Points

* `TestRunnerAgent`: writes test results on completion
* `AgentVersionManager`: attaches test run metadata to versions
* `EvaluatorAgent`: reads historical outcomes for quality scoring
* `AgentUI`: queries historical data for test traceability

---

## 6. Query Patterns

* Recent test runs by agent and version
* Failed tests within last 7 days
* Compare result trend between two versions
* List agents with high failure rates

---

The `TestRunHistoryStore` is a foundational component of T‑Developer’s quality infrastructure. It enables reproducibility, auditability, and data-driven insights into agent behavior across time and versions.
