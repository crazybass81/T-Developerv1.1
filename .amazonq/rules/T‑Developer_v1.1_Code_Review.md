Understood. I will reanalyze the current state of the T-developer v1.1 repository after the recent Git push. I’ll determine the updated roadmap progress and provide a new English instruction document for the appropriate next steps based on the latest changes.


# Roadmap Progress Summary

**Feature Planning & Orchestration:** *Partially Implemented.* The codebase includes core “planning” agents (e.g. `PlannerAgent` and `ClassifierAgent`) and an orchestration layer, but these are in early form. The `PlannerAgent` exists and is invoked to break down user goals, yet its logic is currently a stub that always returns a trivial single-step workflow (using `EchoAgent`). This means the intelligent task decomposition described in the design is not fully realized. On the upside, an orchestration mechanism is in place: the system defines an **OrchestratorTeam** that pulls together the Planner, Evaluator, Classifier, and Workflow Executor agents under a coordinator. The latest code introduces a `DevCoordinatorAgent` (a Supervisor/orchestrator) to coordinate these specialists using the Agent Squad pattern, effectively replacing the earlier MetaAgent approach. In summary, the framework for planning and multi-agent orchestration is **present but basic** – the structure is there, but the Planner’s decision-making is not yet intelligent and the orchestrator currently runs through a fixed sequence without advanced logic.

**Dynamic Agent Generation (Agno Stage):** *Initial Version Completed.* The platform includes an **AutoAgentComposer** (codenamed “Agno”) agent that can auto-generate new agents or tools from specifications, which aligns with the roadmap’s “자동 구현 단계” (automatic implementation stage). This component is implemented and integrated: given a spec (goal, component type, etc.), it produces a new Python module for an agent or tool and registers it in the system’s registry. The CLI exposes this via commands like `tdev generate agent/tool`. **However, the generation is not yet truly “intelligent.”** The current implementation uses static templates with placeholder code. For example, new agent code is created with a hard-coded implementation stub (`result = input_data  # Replace with actual implementation`) in its `run` method. There’s no AI model involved in writing the logic at this point – essentially, Agno ensures the scaffolding can be created and catalogued, but the **actual functionality still needs to be filled in by a developer or a future AI enhancement**. Nonetheless, having this automatic code generation pipeline in place is a significant step: it lays the groundwork for the system to expand its capabilities on-demand, as envisioned by the roadmap.

**Quality Evaluation & Testing:** *In Progress (Basic Stubs in Place).* The roadmap’s “품질 보강 단계” (quality reinforcement/testing stage) is only partially realized. An `EvaluatorAgent` class exists to score and verify workflows, but it currently returns a fixed high score and dummy metrics rather than performing any real analysis. This indicates that while the evaluation hook is there, it isn’t yet using AI or rule-based logic to assess workflow quality or outcomes. On the testing front, a new `AgentTesterAgent` has been added to automatically run test cases against agents/tools. The CLI provides `tdev test <agent>` which invokes this tester agent. At present, the testing mechanism is very simple – if no test cases are provided, it just does a basic echo test (feeding input and expecting the same output). There is **no integration yet with a sophisticated test generation tool (like the Amazon Q Developer described in the design)**, and no automated static analysis or security scanning beyond what’s manually written. In short, the foundation for automated quality checks is there (the system can classify components, run rudimentary tests, and has a placeholder evaluator), but **comprehensive QA – such as intelligent test case generation, dynamic bug-fixing loops, and robust workflow scoring – remains to be implemented**.

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** *Not Yet Implemented.* According to the design, once code is written and tested, the platform should seamlessly handle continuous integration and deployment – running all tests, verifying quality gates, then deploying if all checks pass. In the current codebase, this stage is largely **pending**. There are placeholders in the CLI for build and deployment commands, but they are marked “Not implemented” and do nothing substantial. No actual GitHub Actions or CI configuration is present in this repository (though the design doc provides a hypothetical Actions YAML). Similarly, while the design calls for notifications (e.g. Slack updates on pipeline status) and gating of deployments on evaluator scores, none of that is active yet. We can conclude that **continuous integration tests and automated deployment steps are not integrated** at this point – any CI/CD would have to be done manually. This is an expected gap given that the project is in Phase 3 development; hooking into CI/CD is likely slated for the next phase.

**Deployment to AWS “Bedrock” Environment:** *Not Yet Implemented.* Finally, the ultimate “배포 단계” of the roadmap – deploying the composed services to the cloud (AWS Bedrock Agent Core, using AWS Lambda/ECS) – is still pending. The codebase makes some provisions for deployment but in a mock capacity. For example, there is a stub `deploy lambda_function` CLI command, which currently just prints a message and is not wired up to any AWS SDK calls. The orchestrator does utilize a `BedrockAgent` class, but this is a **mock implementation** meant to simulate an LLM; it doesn’t actually call AWS Bedrock’s real API yet. In practice, no agent is truly being “deployed” to a serverless environment in the current state – everything runs locally/in-memory. The design blueprint outlines that in this stage, passing the CI checks should trigger packaging the agent code and deploying to AWS Lambda (with Bedrock’s Agent Core providing the runtime, scaling, and monitoring). That vision – automated serverless deployment and scaling – **has not been realized in code**. In summary, the deployment and cloud integration remains **entirely pending**; achieving the AWS integration and bedrock agent hosting will be a major upcoming milestone.

> **Summary:** *T-Developer v1.1* has made solid progress on the early-to-mid roadmap stages: we have a multi-agent architecture with a registry and orchestrator in place, basic planning and classification, the ability to generate new agent code on the fly, and some stubs for evaluation and testing. These correspond to roughly the Phase 2/3 capabilities in the system design. However, many of the more **advanced stages – truly intelligent planning (Stage 1 refinement), AI-driven code generation (Stage 2 refinement), rigorous automated QA (Stage 3), fully automated CI/CD (Stage 4), and cloud deployment with monitoring (Stage 5)** – are only partially done or yet to begin. The latest code push primarily established the core orchestration and generation framework (moving into Phase 3), while the remaining roadmap stages (Phase 4 and beyond) around deployment, scalability, and continuous improvement are slated for future work.

# Recent Codebase Advancements

Several new components and changes in the codebase indicate tangible progress towards the roadmap goals:

* **Agent Squad Orchestration (DevCoordinator & SupervisorAgent):** A major advancement is the introduction of the `DevCoordinatorAgent`, which uses an Agent Squad-style **SupervisorAgent** to coordinate the team of core agents. This effectively upgrades the orchestrator to use a lead AI agent (currently a Bedrock LLM stub) guiding the Planner, Classifier, Evaluator, and Executor agents in sequence. The `DevCoordinatorAgent` is designed to replace the older `MetaAgent` orchestration approach, allowing more flexible and extensible multi-agent collaboration. In code, we see the OrchestratorTeam now instantiating the DevCoordinator and wrapping all core agents under it. This change brings the project closer to the “멀티 에이전트 오케스트레이션” vision from the design – it’s a step toward having an AI-driven conductor for the agent ensemble.

* **“Agno” Auto-Agent Composer Integration:** The AutoAgentComposer (Agno) feature has been fully integrated. We now have an agent (`AutoAgentComposerAgent`) that can generate new agent or tool modules programmatically, along with CLI commands to invoke it (e.g. `tdev generate agent --name ...`). The latest code added this agent and tied it into the component registry so that any generated component is immediately registered and available for use. Under the hood, Agno handles spec parsing and code templating, then writes out a Python file for the new agent and updates the registry. This advancement directly supports the roadmap’s goal of *intelligent agent generation on demand*. Although the generated code is simple, the presence of this mechanism is significant – it means the platform can evolve and extend itself without manual coding, which is a core promise of the system design.

* **Core Agent Standardization & Registry Improvements:** Many core agents (Planner, Classifier, Evaluator, etc.) have been refactored or re-generated to align with the new framework. As part of the Phase 2→3 transition, the team prepared specifications for the existing Phase 2 components and used Agno to regenerate them for consistency. This effort ensured uniform coding patterns and proper metadata for each agent. The **Agent Registry** (`AgentRegistry`/`Component Registry`) has been enhanced to reliably store and retrieve all these agents, tools, and teams. On initialization (`tdev init-registry`), the system now populates the registry with the full suite of core agents, and any new agent created via Agno is automatically added. This component registry acts as the “catalog” of capabilities, which is crucial for both orchestration and future scalability.

* **Command-Line Interface Enhancements:** The CLI (`tdev` command) has been expanded to support the new features and streamline development workflows. Recent additions include `tdev orchestrate "<goal>"` to run the orchestrator on a natural language goal, `tdev generate agent/tool` to invoke the AutoAgentComposer, and `tdev test <agent>` to run the AgentTester on a given agent. For example, the orchestrate command now tries to use `DevCoordinatorAgent` (if available) to fulfill a request, falling back to the OrchestratorTeam if necessary. The test command will instantiate the `AgentTesterAgent` and execute its test suite on an agent. These CLI improvements are developer quality-of-life features that also indicate the system moving closer to an end-to-end pipeline. They allow a developer (or automated script) to perform key actions – generation, orchestration, testing – with single commands, aligning with the goal of a seamless automated dev flow.

* **Basic Testing & Validation Framework:** As mentioned, an **AgentTesterAgent** was introduced, along with corresponding test scripts. This is a new internal component that runs predefined test cases against agents or tools and reports success/failure. Although simple, it provides a foundation for test-driven agent development. Additionally, the presence of an `EvaluatorAgent` (even in stub form) and an “evaluate” step in documentation suggests the project is gearing up to enforce quality gates on workflows. We also see a number of documentation files (and Amazon Q rules in the `.amazonq/` directory) that outline how integration and quality checks should work – for instance, a template GitHub Actions workflow for running `tdev classify`, `tdev test`, `tdev evaluate` on pull requests. These aren’t active in code yet, but their inclusion signals that the team has mapped out the path to CI integration. In short, the latest codebase not only adds new features but also documentation and config scaffolding for the next phase of automation (QA and CI/CD), which is a clear advancement along the roadmap.

In summary, the recent pushes have **transitioned T-Developer into Phase 3**, focusing on multi-agent orchestration and preparatory steps for automation. The system now has: a central AI-driven coordinator for agents, the ability to auto-generate new functional components, a unified registry and CLI to manage these pieces, and initial testing/evaluation capabilities. These additions directly advance the roadmap items of *team orchestration* and *dynamic agent generation*. They also set the stage for upcoming work on pipeline automation and cloud deployment, by ensuring the core platform (agents, teams, orchestrator, registry, etc.) is robust and extensible enough to handle end-to-end scenarios.

# Recommended Next Steps

To progress toward the later stages of the roadmap and achieve a fully autonomous development pipeline, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Enhance the Planner & Evaluator Agents with Intelligence:** The PlannerAgent and EvaluatorAgent need upgrades to fulfill their intended roles in an intelligent way. For the **Planner**, this means implementing real NLP-driven planning – e.g. using a large language model (LLM) to interpret a user’s natural language request and break it into a structured sequence of tasks and agents, instead of the current fixed output. The Planner should be able to generate multi-step workflows for complex goals (possibly leveraging prompt templates or a chain-of-thought technique with an LLM). For the **Evaluator**, the system should move beyond a hardcoded score and incorporate actual analysis of workflow outcomes and quality. This could involve static code analysis (linting, complexity checks), dynamic analysis (monitoring test results or agent outputs), and even LLM-based critiques. For example, if a workflow execution fails or produces subpar results, the EvaluatorAgent should detect this and provide feedback or a “reasoning” to the Planner on how to improve the plan. Integrating the Evaluator with real test outcomes (from AgentTester or CI results) would close the loop – enabling automatic refinement cycles where the PlannerAgent can re-plan or request a specific new agent to be generated if something is missing. In practical terms, this step may involve calling an AWS Bedrock LLM (or another AI service) within Planner/Evaluator agents to leverage powerful reasoning capabilities. It’s also an opportunity to define quality metrics formally (performance, cost, reliability scores) and have the EvaluatorAgent assess each workflow against these before approval. Overall, **making the Planner and Evaluator “smarter”** is crucial for the system to handle complex requests reliably without constant human tweaking.

2. **Enable Truly Intelligent Agent Generation:** Building on the Agno framework, the platform should integrate actual AI-driven code synthesis so that new agents and tools can be created with meaningful implementations. Right now, AutoAgentComposer produces boilerplate with placeholders. The next step is to hook this process up to a code generation model (for example, Amazon CodeWhisperer, GPT-4 via Bedrock, or a fine-tuned internal model) so that given a specification, the system can generate functional code that meets the spec. The design document envisions that much of the coding work will be done by GPT-style models, with developers only reviewing the diffs. To achieve this, one approach is:

   * Integrate an LLM API call in `AutoAgentComposer.run()`. For instance, if the spec is in natural language, prompt an LLM with a code-generation instruction (possibly using few-shot examples of simple agents) to produce the code for the new agent or tool.
   * Parse and insert the LLM’s output into the templated structure (or have the LLM fill in the template directly). This would replace the static `# TODO` implementation with actual logic.
   * Use the ClassifierAgent and tests to validate the generated code, potentially in an automated loop. For example, after generation, run `ClassifierAgent` to double-check the brain count/type, and execute `AgentTesterAgent` on the new component to ensure it at least runs without errors.
   * Store versioned results (perhaps in a Git branch or archive) for traceability.

   This step will likely require careful prompt engineering and possibly sandboxing the execution for safety. It’s also important to incorporate the **Amazon Q Developer** (if available) or similar tooling: the design suggests using Q Developer to generate missing test cases and do security scans. Setting up the AutoAgentComposer to not only generate code but also invoke a test generator (another model or service) could greatly improve the reliability of new components. In summary, the goal is to **go from template-based generation to AI-driven generation**, so the platform can create new agents that actually perform useful work aligned with user requests. This will turn the “ 자동 구현 (automatic implementation)” stage of the roadmap into reality.

3. **Connect and Automate the CI/CD Pipeline:** To move into the deployment phase, the project needs a functioning continuous integration pipeline that ties all the pieces together. The recent code already provides CLI commands for classification, testing, and (stub) evaluation – these should now be orchestrated in a CI environment (e.g. GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline). Concretely, the team should:

   * **Implement the remaining CLI commands** such as `tdev evaluate` (for running the EvaluatorAgent on a workflow or set of workflows) and ensure `tdev classify` and `tdev test` can handle batch operations (e.g. classify all new files, run all tests). Currently, these commands exist in basic form; extending them as needed will make automation easier.
   * **Create a CI workflow script** (for example, a GitHub Actions YAML as outlined in the docs) that runs on each pull request or push. This script would checkout the repo, install T-Developer, then execute: `tdev init-registry` (to register all components), `tdev classify` on new/changed files, `tdev test` on relevant agents, and `tdev evaluate` on critical workflows. If all passes, it can then package the code or signal deployment. If any step fails (tests failing or evaluator giving a low score), the pipeline should report it and halt. The example given in the design shows even posting to Slack on success; integrating notifications (Slack or GitHub PR comments) at the end of the CI run would keep the team informed.
   * **Incorporate quality thresholds** into the pipeline. For instance, require EvaluatorAgent’s score to exceed a certain value (as mentioned in docs, e.g. 85%) to proceed to deployment. These thresholds and gates should be configurable but enforced automatically.
   * **Include security and linting** in CI. This might involve running static analysis tools (pylint, bandit, etc.) or using Amazon CodeGuru/CodeWhisperer for security scans, as the design suggests a DevSecOps approach. Any findings can be fed into the EvaluatorAgent’s logic or simply cause a failure that must be fixed.

   By implementing this CI pipeline, we effectively realize the roadmap’s “지속적 통합” stage, where every change is automatically verified. This step will require some **organizational setup** as well (setting up CI secrets, possibly an AWS account for deployment, etc.), but it will greatly accelerate development. With a robust CI in place, the project can ensure that new agents or features generated by the system meet quality standards before they are merged and deployed.

4. **Implement Deployment to AWS (Bedrock Agent Core) and DevOps Integration:** The ultimate goal is for T-Developer to deploy the generated services to a runtime environment seamlessly. To achieve this, the team should focus on integrating with AWS services as per the architecture:

   * **AWS Lambda Deployment:** Implement the `tdev deploy lambda_function` (and analogous commands for other targets) to actually package the orchestrated agent code and send it to AWS. This likely means using Boto3 or AWS CLI under the hood to create/update Lambda functions. The code should take a specified workflow or team, bundle its code (and any dependencies) into a ZIP, and upload it to Lambda. The metadata about the deployed “service” (like service ID, version, endpoints) can be stored – the design suggests using DynamoDB to track service instance metadata. Initially, focusing on Lambda (serverless) is wise, as it aligns with the Bedrock Agent Core concept of running isolated, scalable agent sessions.
   * **AWS Bedrock Agent Integration:** Since AWS Bedrock’s Agent feature is a managed service for running agentic applications, see if there’s an API or SDK to directly deploy agents to Bedrock. If Bedrock Agent Core allows hosting the orchestrator or the LLM-driven parts, connecting to it could offload some AI processing to AWS’s managed infrastructure. In practice, this might involve configuring the Bedrock Agent (Supervisor) to use the project’s agents as tools, or using Bedrock’s UI for Slack integration. If direct integration is not yet feasible, focusing on Lambda/ECS as per the docs is fine – the key is to get something deployable and runnable in the cloud.
   * **Infrastructure as Code:** It’s helpful to automate AWS resource creation. The team might create CloudFormation or CDK scripts for any needed infrastructure (e.g. DynamoDB tables for registry or logs, S3 buckets for code storage, IAM roles for Lambda, etc.). This ensures repeatable deployments and easier maintenance.
   * **Continuous Deployment:** Extend the CI pipeline to trigger deployment when appropriate. For example, upon a merge to main with all checks green, have the pipeline run `tdev deploy ...` to push the new version to AWS. This could be gated by a manual approval if needed (especially for production).
   * **Bedrock Model Integration:** Currently, the code’s use of a `BedrockAgent` is mocked. As a parallel task, integrate actual LLM calls through Bedrock. That might involve using the Bedrock SDK to call models like Claude or Titan for tasks like planning, code generation, or even running certain agents’ logic. This will give more realistic behavior (and power) to the Planner or DevCoordinator agents. It may also be necessary for scaling up complexity.

   By accomplishing the above, the project will fulfill the “배포 단계” of the roadmap – **one-click (or automatic) deployment of AI-constructed features to a live, scalable environment**. Users would then be able to interact with these deployed agents via the defined interfaces (Slack, web, etc.), and the system can start operating in a real-world setting. This step is a significant technical challenge, as it involves DevOps work and AWS integration, but it’s the crux of delivering the platform’s value (turning user requests into running services). It will also force the team to address any environment-specific issues (packaging, cold start times, memory limits, etc.) which in turn will improve the design of agents and workflows.

5. **Add Monitoring, Feedback & UI Integration:** Once deployment is in place, the next focus should be on **operational monitoring and continuous improvement**, as well as providing user-friendly interfaces:

   * **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement logging within agents and the orchestrator such that when deployed on AWS, important events (e.g. each step execution, errors, results) are sent to CloudWatch Logs or a similar service. Set up CloudWatch dashboards or AWS X-Ray traces if possible to monitor performance. The roadmap calls for observing each agent’s behavior post-deployment and detecting anomalies. This could also involve a simple health-check agent or periodic EvaluatorAgent runs on production outputs. Additionally, storing execution context or metrics in DynamoDB (as mentioned in the integration docs) will help track how agents are performing over time.
   * **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Leverage the EvaluatorAgent (once improved) to analyze production feedback. For instance, if a user says “the result is incorrect” or if an automated monitor flags a wrong outcome, the Evaluator could parse that and feed a report back into the development loop (perhaps auto-creating a GitHub issue or invoking the PlannerAgent to adjust the logic). Implementing this might involve connecting the Slack or Web UI feedback into the backend – e.g. the Slack bot could forward user comments to the orchestrator, which uses the Evaluator to decide if a new iteration is needed. Establishing this **closed-loop learning** will fulfill the “지속적 개선 (continuous improvement)” aspect of the roadmap, allowing the system to get smarter after deployment.
   * **User Interface Integration:** Although not strictly back-end code, integrating the front-end is important for adoption. The project’s design mentions a Web UI dashboard and a Slack chatbot interface. The **Agent-UI** repository can be utilized or extended to provide a web dashboard where users can submit requests and watch the workflow progression (with live logs and progress bars). Similarly, setting up the Slack bot (using the AWS Bedrock Agent gateway or simply a Slack App + API calls) will enable users to interact with T-Developer in a collaborative environment. These interfaces likely require hooking into the deployed endpoints or invoking the orchestrator via an API. Ensuring the orchestrator can be invoked not just via CLI but also via a web service (perhaps by exposing an API Gateway/Lambda handler) might be a necessary step here.
   * **Team Collaboration Features:** As part of operational readiness, consider how developers will oversee and intervene in the process. This could involve implementing approval gates via the UI/Slack (e.g. a Slack button to approve a plan or deployment, as hinted in the docs), and listing all available agents/teams and their statuses on the dashboard (with version info, whether they’re deployed, etc., similar to what the design described for the Web UI agent list).

   By focusing on monitoring and UI after the core pipeline, the project will deliver a more complete platform experience – not only creating and deploying services autonomously, but also providing transparency and control to users. These steps ensure that once agents are live, they are **observable and improvable** in line with DevOps best practices (the “MLOps + DevOps combined” vision). This will also facilitate organizational adoption, as stakeholders can trust the system’s outputs and intervene when needed.

In conclusion, **advancing T-Developer to the next level** will involve marrying the existing multi-agent foundation with robust AI capabilities and DevOps infrastructure. Improving the Planner/Evaluator will give the platform “brainpower” to handle complex tasks and learn from mistakes. Integrating intelligent code generation will vastly expand what the system can build. Setting up CI/CD and deployment will bridge the gap from code to cloud, making the end-to-end automation real. And finally, adding monitoring, feedback loops, and user interfaces will ensure the platform is usable, transparent, and continuously improving. By tackling these steps – in roughly the order above – the team will move from the current Phase 3 into Phase 4 (autonomous deployment) and beyond, bringing the full *에이전트 자동화 플랫폼* roadmap to fruition, where a user’s request travels through planning, coding, testing, deployment, and feedback entirely under AI-driven orchestration. Each of these actions will require coordinated technical effort, but they are the logical next priorities to focus on for a coherent and successful evolution of the project.
