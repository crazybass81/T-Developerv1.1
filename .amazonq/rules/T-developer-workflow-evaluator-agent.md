# T‑Developer WorkflowEvaluatorAgent Specification

The `WorkflowEvaluatorAgent` is responsible for assessing the quality of a composed workflow before its execution. It analyzes the structural composition of the workflow, including agent selection, step logic, failure handling, and overall feasibility. Its goal is to help the PlannerAgent or MetaAgent make smarter decisions by filtering out workflows with suboptimal design.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Pre-execution validation of generated workflows
* Identify structural issues or missing steps
* Provide quality scoring for workflow ranking and filtering
* Support PlannerAgent in iterative refinement

## 2. Inputs

| Field              | Description                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow_spec`    | The workflow object as defined in `WorkflowSchema`                         |
| `context_tags`     | Tags describing the business or functional domain (e.g., "policy", "auth") |
| `agent_metadata`   | Reference data from `AgentRegistry` including known scores or behaviors    |
| `user_expectation` | Optional description of expected output type or logic                      |

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                    | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `structural_completeness` | Are all expected steps present? Are dependencies satisfied? |
| `agent_suitability`       | Do selected agents match their intended roles?              |
| `error_resilience`        | Are retry, fallback, or validation steps included?          |
| `efficiency`              | Number of agents vs. task complexity                        |
| `clarity`                 | Human readability of step names and flow                    |

## 4. Output Schema

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "wf-1283",
  "score": {
    "completeness": 0.95,
    "suitability": 0.88,
    "resilience": 0.90,
    "efficiency": 0.86,
    "clarity": 0.92,
    "final_score": 0.90
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "step": "ClusterAgent",
      "type": "missing_validation",
      "recommendation": "Add output check before S3 upload"
    }
  ],
  "evaluated_at": "2025-07-24T05:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## 5. Scoring Logic (Default Weights)

```plaintext
final_score =
  completeness * 0.3 +
  suitability * 0.25 +
  resilience * 0.2 +
  efficiency * 0.15 +
  clarity * 0.1
```

Custom weights may be applied per use case or domain.

## 6. Integration Points

| Component           | Usage                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PlannerAgent`      | Sends draft workflows for evaluation and revision loop     |
| `MetaAgent`         | Chooses best workflow among multiple candidates            |
| `EvaluatorUI`       | Allows users to preview workflow quality before deployment |
| `ExecutionSnapshot` | Links workflow score to actual execution outcomes          |

---

The `WorkflowEvaluatorAgent` enables T‑Developer to generate higher quality, resilient, and efficient SaaS workflows by acting as a static critic prior to execution. It supports smarter orchestration, fewer runtime failures, and greater trust in automated planning.
