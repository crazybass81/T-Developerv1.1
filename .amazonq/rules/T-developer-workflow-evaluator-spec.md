# T‑Developer WorkflowEvaluatorAgent Specification

The `WorkflowEvaluatorAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for scoring, validating, and analyzing workflows generated by PlannerAgent or MetaAgent. It determines the quality, stability, efficiency, and composability of a workflow before it is executed or deployed.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Score workflows on dimensions such as quality, complexity, cost, and accuracy
* Validate agent compatibility and data flow integrity
* Provide explanations and breakdowns for failed or suboptimal workflows
* Offer suggestions for planner re-runs or agent substitutions

---

## 2. Evaluation Dimensions

| Metric                | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quality_score`       | General score based on completeness and goal fitness          |
| `cost_estimate`       | Aggregated estimate of compute time, API calls, or LLM tokens |
| `latency`             | Estimated runtime or step-level execution time                |
| `reuse_score`         | Degree to which known reusable agents/tools are used          |
| `composability_score` | Inter-agent type compatibility and schema match               |
| `robustness_score`    | How fault-tolerant or retry-capable the workflow is           |

## 3. Input & Output Schema

### Input

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "abc123",
  "workflow_spec": { ... },
  "context": {
    "goal": "Summarize documents and store to S3",
    "user_tier": "pro"
  }
}
```

### Output

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "abc123",
  "quality_score": 0.87,
  "cost_estimate": "$0.13",
  "reuse_score": 0.92,
  "composability_score": 0.83,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider replacing TranslatorAgent with ReusableTranslatorAgent",
    "Workflow input schema mismatch at step 2"
  ]
}
```

## 4. Integration Points

* `PlannerAgent`: Passes composed workflows to be scored
* `MetaAgent`: Decides which evaluated workflow to execute
* `UI Launcher`: Visual feedback on evaluation results
* `AgentRegistry`: Used to cross-check schema compatibility and reuse tiers

---

## 5. Evaluation Models

* Rule-based scoring engine (YAML rule sets, LLM-enabled patterns)
* Optional integration with LLMs for fuzzy compatibility checks
* Historical benchmarks for team-based workflows (average scores, failure rates)

---

## 6. Future Extensions

* Live comparison dashboard for multiple planner outputs
* Bias detection in agent selection (e.g., overuse of same agent types)
* Integration with AutoAgentComposer feedback loop
* Cost optimization recommendations based on model availability

---

The `WorkflowEvaluatorAgent` provides critical feedback for safe and efficient orchestration in T‑Developer. It ensures workflows are not only valid but optimal for cost, reuse, and robustness before execution.
