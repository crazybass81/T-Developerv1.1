# Tâ€‘Developer DevSecOps Integration Design

This document defines the DevSecOps architecture in which Tâ€‘Developer agents and workflows are automatically validated, deployed, and reported through GitHub Actions, Slack, S3, CloudWatch, and more. This enables full automation across the lifecycle: Agent Definition â†’ Testing â†’ Classification â†’ Storage â†’ Deployment â†’ Monitoring.

---

## 1. Objectives

* Integrate `tdev` CLI with GitHub PR workflows
* Automatically invoke AgentTesterAgent, ClassifierAgent, and EvaluatorAgent
* Deploy to Lambda/ECS upon PR merge
* Deliver feedback to Slack for visibility

---

## 2. Overall Flow

```plaintext
[Developer Commit/PR]
     â†“
[GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/tdev.yml]
     â†“
- Run `tdev classify`
- Run `tdev test`
- Run `tdev evaluate`
     â†“
- Attach summary to PR comment or GitHub Check Run
- Post summarized results to Slack
     â†“
[If conditions met â†’ Auto deploy to Lambda or ECS]
```

---

## 3. GitHub Actions Sample (Simplified)

```yaml
name: T-Dev QA
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  qa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - name: Run classify
        run: tdev classify ./agents/**/*.py
      - name: Run tests
        run: tdev test all
      - name: Run evaluator
        run: tdev evaluate ./workflows/*.json
      - name: Post to Slack
        run: ./scripts/slack_notify.sh "âœ… All checks passed!"
```

---

## 4. Slack Integration

### Trigger Events

* Test pass/failure
* ClassifierAgent result summary
* Deployment complete notifications

### Message Example

```
ðŸ“¦ New Agent: SummarizerAgent classified as `agent`
âœ… Tests passed (3/3)
ðŸ§  Evaluator Score: 91 (A-)
ðŸš€ Deployed to Lambda: arn:aws:lambda:...
```

---

## 5. Deployment Integration

* Via `tdev deploy` CLI or GitHub Action step
* Lambda:

  * Create zip â†’ Upload â†’ Update function code
* ECS:

  * Dockerfile â†’ ECR push â†’ ECS service update

---

## 6. Execution Logs / Security Control

* All test results are logged in CloudWatch
* Use `tdev test --log` or `AgentTesterAgent(..., log=True)`
* Archived zip files optionally uploaded to S3
* Future: auto-apply IAM least privilege policies

---

## 7. Future Extensions

* Auto-run PlannerAgent on PR creation â†’ attach workflow suggestion
* Auto-request review from Q-Developer on agent generation
* Deployment approval via GitHub Approvers + Slack buttons

---

This DevSecOps architecture enables rapid and secure deployment of agents and SaaS products by automating the full lifecycle within the Tâ€‘Developer platform.
