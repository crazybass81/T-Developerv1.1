# T‑Developer AgentTestSuite Specification

The `AgentTestSuite` defines a reusable testing framework for validating individual tools and agents within the T‑Developer ecosystem. Each test case simulates realistic inputs and verifies expected behavior, ensuring agent correctness, reliability, and compatibility.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Ensure correctness and reproducibility of agent logic
* Detect regressions across agent version updates
* Validate input/output schema consistency
* Enable offline or CI-integrated agent testing

---

## 2. Test Structure

Each test suite consists of multiple test cases:

| Field        | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_name` | Name of the agent under test                  |
| `version`    | Target version (optional, defaults to latest) |
| `test_cases` | Array of test inputs/expected outputs         |

Each `test_case` includes:

| Field         | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | What the test is validating                          |
| `input`       | Input to feed the agent                              |
| `expected`    | Expected output (strict or fuzzy match)              |
| `strict`      | Boolean: whether to match exactly or allow variation |
| `timeout`     | Optional time limit in seconds                       |

## 3. Example JSON

```json
{
  "agent_name": "SummarizerAgent",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "description": "Short paragraph summarization",
      "input": "T-Developer is an agent orchestration system...",
      "expected": "A summary of T-Developer's agent orchestration features",
      "strict": true
    },
    {
      "description": "Empty string input",
      "input": "",
      "expected": "",
      "strict": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 4. Evaluation & Scoring

* Pass/fail recorded per test case
* Summary report includes:

  * Total passed / failed
  * Average response time
  * Schema conformance ratio
* Optionally stored as part of ExecutionSnapshot

---

## 5. Integration Points

* `AgentVersionManager`: triggers re-tests on version change
* `TestRunnerAgent`: executes test suites in CI or dev mode
* `AgentStore`: persists test suite definitions alongside agents
* `EvaluatorAgent`: may refer to historical test results for scoring

---

## 6. Future Extensions

* Fuzzy LLM-based result comparison
* Agent health score derived from periodic test runs
* Snapshot-based backtesting using real world inputs
* YAML-to-JSON converter for human-writable test definitions

---

The `AgentTestSuite` ensures that all agents in the T‑Developer ecosystem behave as expected, across versions and in varying contexts, enabling reliability and continuous improvement.
