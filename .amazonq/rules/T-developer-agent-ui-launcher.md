# T‑Developer Agent UI Launcher Specification

The `Agent UI Launcher` is a lightweight runtime environment that allows a single Tool or Agent to be executed directly in the web browser. It enables input configuration and visual inspection of results and is useful for testing, demos, and interactive workflows.

---

## 1. Purpose

* Run agents directly from the browser and view results
* Automatically generate input forms based on schema
* Visualize results and trace logs
* Potential integration into future Agent Marketplace frontend

---

## 2. Input Structure

```json
{
  "agent": "SummarizerAgent",
  "input": {
    "text": "Enter the sentence to summarize."
  }
}
```

Or auto-fetched from the registry:

```json
{
  "agent": "QRCodeResolverAgent"
}
```

---

## 3. UI Components

* 🔲 Input form (auto-generated from schema)
* 🟩 Execute button (triggers `run`)
* 📤 Output display (formatted result)
* 📜 Trace log viewer (execution time, step-by-step outputs)
* 🔁 Retry button on failure

---

## 4. Backend Integration Flow

```plaintext
1. User configures input via UI
2. API call to `/run-agent`
   - Payload: { agent, input }
3. Internally loads from AgentRegistry → calls agent.run(input)
4. Returns result, duration, trace
5. UI renders the result and log
```

## 5. System Requirements

| Component    | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend     | Lightweight dashboard (React / Vue)        |
| Backend API  | FastAPI / Flask (`POST /run-agent`)        |
| Agent Loader | Uses AgentRegistry or AgentRunner          |
| Deployment   | S3 static hosting + Lambda backend capable |

---

## 6. Planned Extensions

* Result persistence: store outputs in S3 or local DB
* Shareable links: share execution results via URL
* Comparison interface: side-by-side input/output comparison
* Multi-agent execution mode (parallel runs via input arrays)

---

The Agent UI Launcher is a core frontend component of T‑Developer, enabling developers, planners, and users to test, compose, and demonstrate agents without code—fulfilling the vision of “zero-code execution.”
